# Design Patterns
- Typical solutions to commonly occurring problems.
- They are like pre-made blueprints that can customize to solve a recurring design problem in code.
- Patterns are often confused with algorithms, because both concepts describe typical solutions to some known problems. While an algorithm always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a pattern is a more high-level description of a solution. The code of the same pattern applied to two different programs may be different.
- An analogy to an algorithm is a cooking recipe: both have clear steps to achieve a goal. On the other hand, a pattern is more like a blueprint: you can see what the result and its features are, but the exact order of implementation is up to you.

# What does the pattern consist of?
- **Intent** of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
- **Motivation** further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
- **Structure** of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
- **Code example** in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.

# Classification of patterns
**Creational** patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing of existing code.
**Structural** patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
**Behavioral** patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
